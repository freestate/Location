README for Location

To use Location you need:
	
	- a running wlan card which can be accessed by iwlist
	- Perl (at least 5.10)
		- libconfig-tiny-perl (Config::Tiny)		
		- libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl (Getopt::Long)
		- libtext-trim-perl (Text::Trim)
		- libarray-diff-perl (Array:Diff)
	- sudo

In order to use this piece of code you have to mask iwlist in /etc/sudoers
so that this can be runned without enterning the password.
Example for this line:	user	ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/iwlist

The configuration is stored in the file in your home directory and is called

	.locationconf
